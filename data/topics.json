These tasks include reasoning, problem-solving, learning, perception, and natural language understanding.\n\nAI can be categorized into two main types: Narrow AI and General AI. Narrow AI is designed to perform specific tasks such as speech recognition or image classification, while General AI would possess the ability to understand, "
