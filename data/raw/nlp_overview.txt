Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field within Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines linguistics, computer science, and machine learning.

Core NLP tasks include tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis. These techniques help break down and analyze text in a structured manner.

Machine learning models like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines were historically used for NLP tasks, but deep learning has revolutionized the field. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers now power most state-of-the-art NLP systems.

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper “Attention Is All You Need,” enabled large-scale pre-trained models such as BERT, GPT, and T5. These models use attention mechanisms to capture contextual meaning in text.

Applications of NLP include chatbots, translation systems, text summarization, sentiment analysis, and voice assistants. With multilingual models and large language models (LLMs), NLP is advancing rapidly toward human-like understanding and generation.
